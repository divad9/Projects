# (US Gun Data analysis)
## by (David Babayo)


## Dataset

>This analyses the FBI gun dataset gotten from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.
    The main goal is to find out the states with the strictest gun laws over the years


## Summary of Findings

>The major aim of this was to determine the states with strictest gun laws over the years in which i found out Hawaii had the best gun laws in place while in current years New jersey has the least and also i have also discovered all the states have increased gun per capita between 2016 and 2010 except 'Utah' ,which can be contributed to the increase of licensed guns to total number of guns in the state my guess is that stricter gun laws have been put in the state.
    some of the limitations i faced in the data set includes the missing census data for a few states like Guam etc and missing data in the guns data set plus wrong data types for certain values for instance numbers saved as strings
