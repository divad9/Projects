    "   In the gathering phase, the first dataset('twitter_archive_enhanced.csv') i downloaded using the requests library same as the second dataset('image_predictions.tsv') while the third i used Tweepy to query Twitter's API having registering for twitters developers account which i was granted access to do so saving the third dataset in Json format('tweet_json.txt') which i had to read in line by line into a dataframe.\n",
