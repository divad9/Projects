# (Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (David Babayo)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, it contains data for over 183400 bike rides containing information from bike ride duration to type of customer, gender etc for February 2019.
     I had to clean up the data a little before i started exploration which involved basically removing null values ,changing value types and engineering new features.


## Summary of Findings

> Most of their members are subscribers with over 90% but shockingly customers have a higher mean duration than subscribers,Most of their members are men with just 10 percent being women ,People harldy share their bike rides and the mean age of their members is 34 ,most bike rides happen in the evening and the least happen in the night ,most bike rides occur around 5pm and 8am and i also shockingly found out that women have a higher mean duration of bike rides than any other gender in the data set.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For my presentation i would like to talk about "Customer vs Subscriber " why customer service type should be discontinued from the bike service, comparing the duration ,number of each type of member and finally mean average duration of bike rides using mainly bar charts,pie charts and a box plot.
